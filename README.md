Data could be stored in an object, with arrays inside the object. The array in the object could be looped through server side with conditionals. Numbers could be stored until actions are detected, those actions then taken on stored numbers. The object would constantly push information client side into the array. Send would send the object. Server would parse through by looping. 


Stretch:
Allow posts to happen only if all inputs are ready - conditional client side.

Allow a user to clear the history by clicking on a button. --Use a delete request instead of get / post. Delete call that wipes the history array.

Allow user to click on a history entry to rerun the calculation. - Jquery selectors, unique identifiers when appended, sent through object and corresponded server side?
